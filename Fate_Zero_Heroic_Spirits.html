    <h1>Heroic Spirits</h1>
    <p class="intro"> Heroic Spirits are spirits of heroes who achieved great deeds in life, having become objects of worship after their deaths.Heroic Spirits are beings of a higher existence, becoming categorically closer to Elementals than wraiths. Differing from how Elementals are "power" granted form using human imagination as a container, they are entirely woven from the ideals of people all throughout. They are freed from the constraints of time itself and removed from the ring of reincarnation, moved to the Throne of Heroes, Those that become closer to the planet do not mix well with people, so they fall into the categories of Divine Spirits and Elementals.</p>
    <div><h3>Archer</h3><br>
        <img src="Fate_Zero_Archer.gif" alt="King of Heroes" class="centre">
        <p class="intro"> Archer is Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes. Gilgamesh is the half-god, half-human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun with the purpose of being a medium between the Gods and humans, as he is both of these things and yet not quite either. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era and was supposedly a transcendent being so divine that no others in the world could match him. He was a despot who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago,He takes great pride in claiming to be the first 'hero' ever to set foot on Earth, causing him to have a severe and sadistic God complex, treating all others as "mongrels" that are not worthy of laying eyes on him. His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is a king over all heroes. His name is derived from traditionally being mankind's oldest hero and the origin to all myths, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. Because of this, his Gate of Babylon possesses every hero’s Noble Phantasm</p>

Stunned to discover that the legendary King Arthur is a young woman, Kiritsugu refused to speak to her directly since her summoning, which Saber initially believes is because he believes the fact that she is a woman makes her inadequate. However, Irisviel later suggests Kiritsugu's anger towards Saber is out of the belief that he could not accept the decisions Saber made or allowed to be made in life yet he could not justify his reasons for why he believed she was wrong.The only knights who know the truth of her gender are her foster brother, Sir Kay, and the king's secretary, Sir Agravain.</p><br>

He is also the only Servant that Gilgamesh truly respects as an equal, the latter inviting him to challenge him in combat as many times as he wished. His wish is for a second life and he plans to wage war against the United States to celebrate his revival, believing they will pose an enjoyable challenge.
